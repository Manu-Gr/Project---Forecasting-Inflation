# Project---Forecasting-Inflation

Analysing the Inflation Trend Over the Historical Data
Finding hidden patterns and trends associated with Inflation across the years
The Data collected from IMF Website from the year 1980 till 2022
The Data is upsampled to get more insights from the data
The Data is upsampled using pandas library
Different Visualizations are plotted to check how the inflation behaves acroos different months
Different Models are checked like Model Based models like Exponential Moving average,qudratic, Quadratic with additive Seasonality, Multiplicative with additive seasonality
The Data driven models like ARMA,ARIMA , Holts Wilter Method were also tried
The LSTM Model gave the best results so it was deployed
